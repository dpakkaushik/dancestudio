# CLAUDE.md — DanceOS

## What this repo is

DanceOS: an app for dance studios and dancers — class management, bookings, crews,
events, discovery. Two things live here:

1. **`prototype/`** — a complete, tested frontend prototype (the product specification)
2. **Repo root** — the real app being built from it: Next.js + Supabase, multi-tenant

## The prototype (`prototype/` — reference only, do not edit)

- `DanceOSApp.jsx` (19,399 lines) — the entire app as one React file. 127 screens,
  all flows working. **This is the product spec**: when building a real feature,
  open the matching prototype screen and match its behavior.
- `DanceOS.html` — self-contained build of the JSX. Double-click to preview locally.
  (The `build.sh` that compiles JSX → HTML is NOT in this repo; don't edit the HTML.)
- `D4-START-HERE.md` / `REVIEW-D3.md` — the prototype's status and review docs
  (16 Aug 2026): 13 Playwright suites green, 22/22 poison boots, all product
  decisions documented there.
- The prototype has **no backend**: all data lives in browser localStorage via
  `dosStorage` (`__DOSACCOUNT`, `__DOSACTIVESTUDIO`, `__DOSEVENTS`, `__DOSBOOKED`,
  `__DOSLINKS`, …). These storage shapes are the source material for the real
  database schema. UI-only keys (`__DOSTHEME`, `__DOSNAV`, `__DOSTAB`) stay client-side.

## Build plan (approved 18 Aug 2026)

| Step | Slice | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Foundations: repo restructure, Next.js scaffold, CI | in progress |
| 1 | Auth + identity: `profiles` + RLS, Supabase Auth, login/roles | next |
| 2 | Tenant onboarding: `tenants`, `tenant_members` + RLS | |
| 3 | Classes: `classes`, `class_sessions` + RLS, manage + list | |
| 4 | Enrollment: `enrollments` + RLS, enroll/cancel/waitlist | |
| 5 | Discovery: PostGIS "near me" | |
| 6 | Hardening: seed data, e2e happy path, deploy, pilot studios | |

Later: Razorpay payments → attendance/CRM → community → events/video → search.

**One step per session.** Each slice is vertical: migration → RLS → repository →
server action → UI, finished and verified before the next begins.

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 (+ shadcn/ui when UI work starts)
- Supabase: Postgres, Auth, Storage; RLS mandatory
- Zod for validation, pnpm for packages
- Razorpay for payments (Phase 2, webhook-driven)

## Rules

1. **Never edit anything in `prototype/`** — it is the reference.
2. **Every table ships with**: UUID PK, `tenant_id` (if tenant-scoped), audit columns
   (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`), soft delete (`deleted_at`),
   and its RLS policy — all in the same migration.
3. **Never modify an applied migration** — write a new one.
4. **No direct Supabase calls from components** — repository layer only
   (`/repositories`), orchestrated by server actions (`/features/*/server-actions`).
5. **Validate every input server-side with Zod.** Never trust the client.
6. **Secrets only in `.env.local`** (gitignored). `.env.local.example` documents the keys.
7. **Pagination on every list endpoint** (cursor-based for feeds).
8. Anything touching money, auth, or RLS gets flagged explicitly in the summary of changes.

## Structure

```
app/            → Next.js routes (thin — no business logic)
features/       → feature slices: components, server-actions, types
repositories/   → all database access, one module per domain
services/       → business logic orchestration
lib/            → shared helpers (auth, formatting)
components/ui/  → shared primitives
types/          → shared types
supabase/
  migrations/   → SQL migrations (never edit applied ones)
prototype/      → the reference prototype (read-only)
```

## Commands

```
pnpm dev        → run locally (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm build      → production build
pnpm lint       → eslint
pnpm typecheck  → tsc --noEmit
```

## Definition of Done (each slice)

- RLS proven with two test tenants (cross-tenant reads fail)
- Zod validation + server-side authorization on every action
- At least one test on the happy path
- Loading and error states in UI
- Demoable in the browser
