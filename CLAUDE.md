# CLAUDE.md — DanceOS

## What this repo is

DanceOS: an app for dance studios and dancers — class management, bookings, crews,
events, discovery. Two things live here:

1. **`prototype/`** — a complete, tested frontend prototype (the product specification)
2. **Repo root** — the real app being built from it: Next.js + Supabase, multi-tenant

## The prototype (`prototype/` — reference only, do not edit)

- `DanceOSApp.jsx` (19,399 lines) — the entire app as one React file. 127 screens,
  all flows working. **This is the product spec**: when building a real feature,
  open the matching prototype screen and match its behavior.
- `DanceOS.html` — self-contained build of the JSX. Double-click to preview locally.
  (The `build.sh` that compiles JSX → HTML is NOT in this repo; don't edit the HTML.)
- `D4-START-HERE.md` / `REVIEW-D3.md` — the prototype's status and review docs
  (16 Aug 2026): 13 Playwright suites green, 22/22 poison boots, all product
  decisions documented there.
- The prototype has **no backend**: all data lives in browser localStorage via
  `dosStorage` (`__DOSACCOUNT`, `__DOSACTIVESTUDIO`, `__DOSEVENTS`, `__DOSBOOKED`,
  `__DOSLINKS`, …). These storage shapes are the source material for the real
  database schema. UI-only keys (`__DOSTHEME`, `__DOSNAV`, `__DOSTAB`) stay client-side.

## Build plan (approved 18 Aug 2026) — the single source of truth

Goal: turn the prototype into a scalable multi-tenant app serving many studios
pan-India. The prototype's `__DOS*` localStorage shapes are the source material
for the database schema. **The UI is not redesigned** — see Rule 2.

| Step | Slice | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Foundations: repo restructure, Next.js scaffold, CI | ✅ done (commit 817d01a) |
| 1 | Auth + identity (mobile-OTP login) | ✅ done (18 Aug 2026) |
| 2 | Tenant onboarding | ⬅ next |
| 3 | Classes | |
| 4 | Enrollment | |
| 5 | Discovery ("near me") | |
| 6 | Hardening & pilot | |

### Step 0 — Foundations ✅
Prototype moved to `prototype/` (byte-identical); Next.js 16 + TypeScript +
Tailwind v4 scaffold at repo root; feature-first folders; GitHub Actions CI
(lint + typecheck + build on every push). Verified: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`,
`pnpm build` all green.

### Step 1 — Auth + Identity ✅ (done 18 Aug 2026)
- Supabase project **danceos** (Mumbai, `wonhocebhckjokfssvja`), linked; keys in `.env.local`
- Migration `20260818070000_create_profiles.sql`: `profiles` (UUID PK ref auth.users,
  full_name, role dancer|trainer|studio, city, audit cols, soft delete) + RLS
  (signed-in read live rows; insert/update own row only) — applied to the live DB
- **Auth is mobile-OTP** (login = phone number, like the prototype's S_auth flow —
  NOT email). Dev uses Supabase test numbers 99999 99999 / 88888 88888, OTP 123456,
  no SMS sent. Before pilot: connect an SMS provider (MSG91/Twilio + India DLT).
  `mailer_autoconfirm` is on (dev); revisit before pilot.
- UI lifted from prototype S_auth (DanceOSApp.jsx:3616-3946): `/login` welcome,
  `/login/phone` sign-in, `/login/verify` OTP boxes, `/onboarding` name+role+city,
  `/` identity header (prototype Home sleeve treatment). Session refresh in `proxy.ts`.
- Verified: `scripts/rls-proof.ps1` — 2 users, cross-user update blocked, impostor
  insert rejected, anonymous reads 0 rows. Build/lint/typecheck green.

### Step 2 — Tenant onboarding
- Migrations: `tenants` (studio | trainer_business, name, location lat/lng,
  visibility), `tenant_members` (user ↔ tenant, role) + RLS: members see only
  their own tenant
- Server actions: create studio / trainer business (Zod-validated)
- UI: minimal onboarding flow (name, type, city/location) lifted from prototype
- **Done when:** two studios exist and each owner sees only their own

### Step 3 — Classes
- Migrations: `classes`, `class_sessions` (tenant_id, style, schedule, capacity,
  price placeholder) + RLS: tenant writes own; public reads listed ones
- Repository + server actions: create / edit / list classes
- UI: studio/trainer class management + learner class listing, lifted from prototype

### Step 4 — Enrollment
- Migration: `enrollments` (session ↔ learner, status incl. waitlist) + RLS
- Server actions: enroll, cancel, capacity check (payments stubbed until Phase 2)
- UI: enroll button, learner's "my classes", studio roster — lifted from prototype

### Step 5 — Discovery ("near me")
- Enable PostGIS; geography column + spatial index on `tenants`
- Server action: studios/trainers within a radius, respecting visibility settings
- UI: discovery list (map view later — Google Maps key needed then)

### Step 6 — Hardening & pilot
- `supabase/seed.sql`: 1 studio, 1 trainer, a few learners
- Playwright e2e: signup → onboard studio → create class → enroll (happy path)
- Deploy to Vercel; invite 1–2 real studios as pilots

### Later phases (not in this plan's scope)
Razorpay payments + attendance + studio CRM → community/feed/reviews →
events/video → search (Typesense) + analytics.

### Execution order — every step follows this exact sequence, no exceptions

1. **Connect** — Supabase project exists and keys are wired in `.env.local`
   (done once in Step 1, then verified at the start of each later step)
2. **Schema** — new migration file in `supabase/migrations/`: tables + RLS policy
   together (Rule 3). Apply and confirm it runs cleanly.
3. **Backend** — repository module + server actions with Zod validation and
   server-side authorization. No UI yet.
4. **UI** — the screen lifted from `prototype/DanceOSApp.jsx` (Rule 2), wired to
   the server actions from step 3.
5. **Verify** — run the step's "done when" test + the Definition of Done checklist,
   demo in the browser. Only then is the step complete.

Never start a later stage before the earlier one is finished (no UI before schema
and backend exist). Never start the next step before the current one passes step 5.

**One step per session.** Each slice is vertical: migration → RLS → repository →
server action → UI, finished and verified before the next begins.

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 (+ shadcn/ui when UI work starts)
- Supabase: Postgres, Auth, Storage; RLS mandatory
- Zod for validation, pnpm for packages
- Razorpay for payments (Phase 2, webhook-driven)

## Rules

1. **Never edit anything in `prototype/`** — it is the reference.
2. **Keep the prototype's UI — do not redesign it.** Every screen's JSX (markup,
   styles, interactions) is lifted directly from `prototype/DanceOSApp.jsx` into the
   real app. Only the data wiring changes: `dosStorage` reads/writes are replaced
   with server actions. The built screen must look identical to the prototype screen.
3. **Every table ships with**: UUID PK, `tenant_id` (if tenant-scoped), audit columns
   (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`), soft delete (`deleted_at`),
   and its RLS policy — all in the same migration.
4. **Never modify an applied migration** — write a new one.
5. **No direct Supabase calls from components** — repository layer only
   (`/repositories`), orchestrated by server actions (`/features/*/server-actions`).
6. **Validate every input server-side with Zod.** Never trust the client.
7. **Secrets only in `.env.local`** (gitignored). `.env.local.example` documents the keys.
8. **Pagination on every list endpoint** (cursor-based for feeds).
9. Anything touching money, auth, or RLS gets flagged explicitly in the summary of changes.

## Structure

```
app/            → Next.js routes (thin — no business logic)
features/       → feature slices: components, server-actions, types
repositories/   → all database access, one module per domain
services/       → business logic orchestration
lib/            → shared helpers (auth, formatting)
components/ui/  → shared primitives
types/          → shared types
supabase/
  migrations/   → SQL migrations (never edit applied ones)
prototype/      → the reference prototype (read-only)
```

## Commands

```
pnpm dev        → run locally (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm build      → production build
pnpm lint       → eslint
pnpm typecheck  → tsc --noEmit
```

## Definition of Done (each slice)

- RLS proven with two test tenants (cross-tenant reads fail)
- Zod validation + server-side authorization on every action
- At least one test on the happy path
- Loading and error states in UI
- Demoable in the browser
